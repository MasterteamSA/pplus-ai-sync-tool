# PPlus AI Sync Tool

Standalone, AI-assisted configuration sync across PPlus instances — dev ↔ stage ↔ prod, or any custom target fan-out.

Built because the previous `ConfigurationDiffTool` (in `MasterteamSA/pplus4-backend`) **didn't copy all configuration** (Dashboards, ChartComponents, Level.Sources were captured but never synced) and **didn't map renamed keys correctly** (naive `string.Replace`, formula rewriting commented out). This rebuild fixes both, adds a proper preview + audit + rollback, and uses Claude to handle semantic entity matching and formula rewriting.

## What's in this repo

```
apps/web/               Next.js 15 app (UI + API routes)
packages/core/          Domain types, matchers, pipeline contracts
packages/connectors/    PPlusConnector interface + RestConnector (HTTP)
packages/ai/            Anthropic client, tool schemas, prompts
packages/formula/       Deterministic {{Key}} parser + rewriter
packages/db/            Drizzle schema, migrations, AES-256-GCM cred store
packages/shared/        Zod schemas + entity-kind presets shared server/client
```

## Current status

Scaffolding pass 1 is done:

- Types / matchers / formula parser are implemented and unit-tested (`pnpm --filter @pplus-sync/formula test`).
- `RestConnector` wires up endpoints, retries, and auth (cookie / bearer / basic).
- `AiClient` wraps the Anthropic SDK with prompt-cached catalogs and the `proposeMapping` / `rewriteFormula` / `classifyRisk` / streamed `explainDiff` tools.
- Drizzle schema covers `runs`, `target_runs`, `snapshots`, `mapping_decisions`, `sync_plans`, `audit_entries`, `applied_ops`, `env_credentials`, `users`.
- Next.js app boots with `/connect` (source + N targets, with Test connection), plus stub pages for `/snapshot`, `/match`, `/diff`, `/apply`, `/history`.

Not yet implemented (next pass):

- Pipeline stage execution (capture / match / diff / plan / apply / rollback)
- Auth (NextAuth operator login) and encrypted credential persistence
- Per-target diff viewer, mapping editor, apply-with-nonce confirm flow

The approved plan is at `~/.claude/plans/curried-inventing-tulip.md`.

## UI

The UI is **Autopilot-first** — `/` redirects to `/autopilot`, and the header
only exposes two entry points:

- **Autopilot** — one-click source → target sync with Claude in the loop.
- **History** — every applied run, with rollback.

The underlying pipeline pages (`/connect`, `/snapshot`, `/match`, `/align`,
`/diff`, `/apply`) still exist and are reachable by direct URL (or from the
`configure` link on Autopilot), but they're no longer surfaced in the nav —
Autopilot handles the happy path end-to-end.

## Quickstart

**Prereqs:** Node 22+ (`node -v` → 22 or newer) and pnpm 9+ (`npm i -g pnpm`).
No Docker, no Postgres, no API keys.

### macOS / Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khalil-am/pplus-ai-sync-tool.git
cd pplus-ai-sync-tool
pnpm dev
```

The first time you run `pnpm dev` it auto-installs dependencies, generates DB
migrations, creates `.env.local`, picks the first free port starting at 3000,
and boots.

### Windows

The top-level `pnpm dev` wrapper relies on `child_process.spawn('pnpm', ...)`,
which Windows can't resolve without `shell: true` — so on Windows run the web
app directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Khalil-am/pplus-ai-sync-tool.git
cd pplus-ai-sync-tool
pnpm install
cd apps/web
pnpm exec next dev --turbopack -p 3000
```

### First run

Open http://localhost:3000 — it redirects to `/autopilot`. The first request
creates an embedded Postgres (PGlite) at `~/.pplus-ai-sync/db`, runs all
migrations, and seeds a default operator user (`admin` / `admin` — override via
`SEED_USER` / `SEED_PASSWORD`).

**AI features** work if the `claude` CLI is installed and signed in on the machine:

```bash
npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code   # if you don't have it
claude                                # sign in once
```

No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed — the tool uses whatever auth the CLI already has.

**Want a real Postgres instead of PGlite?** Set `DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@host/db` in `.env.local` — the schema is identical.

## Design decisions

- **API-first** — the connector hits PPlus REST endpoints, not the database. Safer (goes through app-layer validation) and works against any deployed instance. A `DbConnector` stub exists for entities the REST API can't round-trip; drivers ship as optional peer deps per install.
- **Formula rewriting is deterministic** — a tiny AST parser handles the `{{Key}}` grammar. Claude's `rewriteFormula` is the fallback only when the parser fails or the formula is embedded JS. Every rewrite is re-parsed and rejected if it introduces an unknown key.
- **Nothing writes without explicit confirmation** — `/apply` requires typing `APPLY <targetHost>` and is gated by a 60 s server nonce.
- **Credentials stay server-side** — AES-256-GCM in Postgres; UI only ever sees `****`.
- **Scope is per-run** — check-box matrix of entity kinds with presets (`Schema only`, `Schema + Dashboards`, `Everything`). Dashboards default to off.
- **Multi-target fan-out** — one source, many targets. Each target is its own sub-run with independent match / diff / plan / apply / rollback state.
